# Capstone - Software Development

## Synopsis
This capstone project is a game called "CODON". A player tries to build the longest amino acid chain they can in the given amount of time.  Inside a ribosome complex, there is an mRNA strand with nucleotide bases A, C, U, and G.  On the letter grid below, the player earns amino acids by finding the "anti-codon" match to the "codon" on the mRNA strand.  The base "A" always pairs with "U", and the base "C" pairs with "G".  The challenge of finding the matching "anti-codon" requires the player to think in reverse.  If the codon is "AGU", then the player must find the anti-codon "UCA" in the letter grid.  If there are no matches in the current letter grid, the player may use one energy to shuffle the letters.  One energy can be earned with every 5 amino acids the player collects.  

## Motivation
This game encourages a casual and fun learning experience while reinforcing concepts about the translational process in cell biology.  I believe science and educational games can and should be fun and engaging, as such an approach bring better learning outcomes.
